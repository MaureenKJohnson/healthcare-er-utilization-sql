## Discussion

This analysis identified differences in emergency department utilization, hospital admission rates, and short-term repeat visit patterns across insurance groups. While these findings are descriptive in nature and do not establish causality, they highlight patterns that may be relevant for and care coordination efforts. 

Patients covered by Medicaid patients demonstrated lower average emergency department utilization but a higher proportion of ER visits resulting in hospital admission. In contrast, Self-Pay patients exhibited the highest ER utilization but the lowest admission rates. Medicare and Medicare Advantage patients showed higher rates of repeat ER visits within 30 days compared to other insurance groups. This pattern may suggest delayed care-seeking or limited access to primary and preventive services, leading to more severe presentations when care is ultimately sought. From an operational perspective, these findings may indicate opportunities for targeted outreach, improved access to primary care, or enhanced care navigation services aimed at reducing preventable hospitalizations.

In contrast, Self-Pay patients exhibited higher ER utilization coupled with lower hospital admission rates. This pattern may reflect use of the emergency department for non-emergent or primary-care–treatable conditions, potentially due to cost barriers or limited awareness of lower-cost care settings. Health systems may consider patient education initiatives, financial counseling, or referral pathways to urgent care or community clinics to better align care settings with patient needs.

Repeat emergency department visits within 30 days were more common among Medicare and Medicare Advantage patients. This finding may reflect greater clinical complexity, multimorbidity, or challenges related to post-discharge care coordination in older adult populations. Improved discharge planning, clearer follow-up instructions, and enhanced communication with outpatient providers may help reduce avoidable return visits in these groups.

Several limitations should be noted. The dataset used for this analysis was synthetic and designed for analytic demonstration purposes; therefore, findings may not generalize to real-world populations. Additionally, the analysis did not account for clinical severity, comorbidities, or social determinants of health, which may influence utilization and admission patterns. Future analyses incorporating these factors, as well as inferential modeling such as logistic regression, could provide deeper insight into the drivers of observed differences.

Despite these limitations, this project demonstrates how SQL-based analysis can be used to identify utilization patterns and generate actionable insights that support operational decision-making in healthcare settings.

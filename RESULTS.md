## Results

### ER Utilization by Insurance Type
Across insurance groups, average emergency department (ED) utilization ranged from 3.09 to 4.04 visits per patient. Self-Pay patients demonstrated the highest average number of ER visits (4.04 visits per patient), while Medicaid patients demonstrated the lowest overall utilization (3.09 visits per patient). Patients with Commercial insurance, Medicare Advantage, and Medicare exhibited intermediate utilization levels, averaging approximately 3.43, 3.51, and 3.77 ER visits per patient, respectively.

These descriptive differences suggest variation in utilization patterns across payer groups; however, no inferential testing was performed to assess the statistical significance of these differences.

### Hospital Admission Rates

Hospital admission rates varied by insurance type, ranging from 0.452 to 0.551 admissions per patient ER visit. Although Medicaid patients demonstrated the lowest overall ER utilization, they exhibited the highest proportion of ER visits resulting in hospital admission (0.551 admissions per visit). 

In contrast, while Self-Pay patients - who had the highest ER utilization - had the lowest admission rate (0.452 admissions per ER visit). Admission rates among Medicare, Commercial, and Medicare Advantage patients were similar, averaging 0.500, 0.493, and 0.492 admissions per ER visit, respectively.

### 30-Day Repeat ER Visits

Thirty-day repeat ER visits also varied across insurance groups, ranging from 4.4% to 12.7 % of ER visits. Medicare patients demonstrated the highest repeat visit rate (12.7%), followed by Medicare Advantage patients (9.5%), and Self-Pay patients (8.6%). compared to other insurance groups. 

Commercially insured patients exhibited lower repeat-visit rates (7.2%) while Medicaid patients demonstrated the lowest repeat-visit rate in this dataset (4.4%).

These findings indicate higher short-term ER return rates among Medicare and Medicare Advantage populations relative to other payer groups; however, results are descriptive and do not account for patient-level complexity or clinical severity.

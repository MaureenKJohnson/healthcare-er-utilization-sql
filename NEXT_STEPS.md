## Next Steps

This analysis focused on descriptive patterns in emergency department utilization, admissions, and short-term repeat visits stratified by insurance type. Several opportunities exist to extend this work in a real-world healthcare analytics setting.

Future analyses could incorporate patient-level clinical and demographic variables, such as age, visit severity, comorbidities, or presenting diagnosis, to better understand drivers of utilization and admission patterns. Adjusting for these factors would allow for more meaningful comparisons across insurance groups.

Inferential modeling techniques, such as logistic regression, could be used to assess the statistical significance of observed differences in admission and 30-day repeat visit rates while controlling for confounding factors. This approach would support risk-adjusted comparisons and more actionable insights.

From an operational perspective, this analysis could be extended by identifying high-risk patient segments for targeted interventions, such as care navigation, post-discharge follow-up, or referral to primary care and community-based services. Repeat-visit metrics could also be monitored over time using dashboards to support quality improvement initiatives.

Finally, integrating these SQL-based analyses into reporting tools such as Excel, Tableau, or Power BI would allow healthcare leaders to track trends, identify emerging utilization issues, and evaluate the impact of intervention strategies.
